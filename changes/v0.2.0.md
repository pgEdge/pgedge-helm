## v0.2.0 - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Added `internalHostname` configuration option for nodes, allowing in-cluster connection checks while preserving the external hostname for spock configuration (useful when clusters prevent hairpinning)
- Automated release workflow that builds/pushes Docker images, GPG-signs Helm charts, and creates GitHub releases with prerelease support
- Automated tag release workflow that creates git tags when release PRs are merged to main
- Release notes integration from `changes/<version>.md` files

### Changed

- init-spock job image now defaults to `ghcr.io/pgedge/pgedge-helm-utils:v<chart-version>` when `initSpockImageName` is not set, eliminating manual version updates during releases
- Improved Helm validation logic so `bootstrap.mode` is only required when `initSpock` is enabled

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate `privateKey` key in client-ca Certificate resource
