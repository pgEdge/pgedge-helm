## v0.1.0 - 2025-12-19

### Added

- Exposed the ability to override the container image used in the init-spock job (thanks @marlenekoh)
- Added documentation describing how to load and configure extensions which are available in the [pgEdge Enterprise Postgres Standard image](https://github.com/pgEdge/postgres-images)

### Changed

- Moved the init-spock job to utilize the [pgedge-helm-utils](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-helm/pkgs/container/pgedge-helm-utils) image instead of downloading python dependencies at runtime
  - The image uses a distroless base image and includes build revision support for versioned releases
  - This enables users to install this chart in on-premise environments, or environments where security controls may have blocked the python dependency installs
- Updated documentation and tests to utilize [CloudNativePG 1.28.0](https://cloudnative-pg.io/releases/cloudnative-pg-1-28.0-released/)
