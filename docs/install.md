# Installation

This guide demonstrates how to install the pgedge-helm chart into a single Kubernetes cluster containing three nodes: n1, n2, and n3.

In this single cluster example, n1 is configured with 3 instances (1 primary, 2 standby), and n2/n3 are configured with just 1 primary instance.

```yaml
pgEdge:
  appName: pgedge
  nodes:
    - name: n1
      hostname: pgedge-n1-rw
      clusterSpec:
        instances: 3
        postgresql:
          synchronous:
            method: any
            number: 1
            dataDurability: required
    - name: n2
      hostname: pgedge-n2-rw
    - name: n3
      hostname: pgedge-n3-rw
  clusterSpec:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
```

**Prerequisites**

To perform the installation, you'll need the following tools installed on your machine:

- `helm`: The package manager for Kubernetes, used to install, upgrade, and manage Kubernetes applications via Helm charts.
    - [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- `kubectl`: The Kubernetes command-line tool, used to interact with and manage your Kubernetes clusters.
    - [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- `kubectl cnpg` plugin: A plugin for `kubectl` that provides additional commands for managing CloudNativePG clusters.
    - [Install CloudNativePG kubectl plugin](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/kubectl-plugin/#install)

## Step 1: Configure your kubectl context and namespace

Before you get started, you should setup your `kubectl` context to interact with the correct cluster and namespace before performing the install.

**Identify Your Kubernetes Cluster and User**

First, you need to know the names of the cluster and user you want to use. You can list them with these commands:

```shell
kubectl config get-clusters
kubectl config get-users
```

The example that follows uses a cluster named `kubernetes`, accessed by a user named `kubernetes-admin`.

**Create the New Context**

Now, create the new context using the cluster and user names you just found.

```shell
kubectl config set-context helm-test --cluster=kubernetes --user=kubernetes-admin
```

This command creates a new context and links it to your existing cluster and user credentials.

**Configuring your kubectl context and namespace**

For convenience, configure your desired context and namespace prior to running the rest of the commands.

```shell
kubectl config use-context <cluster-context> --namespace <desired-namespace>
```

For example:

```shell
kubectl config use-context helm-test --namespace pgedge
```

## Step 2: Install chart dependencies

First, install the `CloudNativePG` and `cert-manager` operators into your cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.27/releases/cnpg-1.27.0.yaml
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f \
https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployment \
	-n cert-manager cert-manager cert-manager-cainjector cert-manager-webhook --timeout=120s
```

## Step 3: Install the chart

To install the Helm chart, you need to run the `helm install` command from the correct directory. This command needs access to two key parts of the downloaded `pgedge-helm` package: 

- the chart itself (the `./` at the end).
- the configuration file (`values.yaml`).
 
1. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**  
   First, change your current directory to the location where you unzipped/downloaded the Helm chart.

2. **Run the Helm Install Command**  
   Once you are in the `pgedge-helm` directory, you can run the `helm install` command. The command uses relative paths, which is why changing directories first is crucial.

```shell
helm install \
--values examples/configs/single/values.yaml \
	--wait \
	pgedge ./
```

### Command Breakdown

- `helm install`: The main command to deploy a Helm chart.
- `--values examples/configs/single/values.yaml`: This flag tells Helm to use a specific configuration file. The path is relative to your current directory.
- `--wait`: This flag ensures that the command waits until all the resources in the chart are ready before marking the installation as complete.
- `pgedge`: This is the **release name** for your Helm chart. You can name this anything you want; it's a unique identifier for your installation.
- `./`: The dot (`.`) at the end is a relative path that tells Helm to install the chart located in the **current directory**.

**NOTE:** This command may take a long time to run depending on your configuration. You can monitor the progress of the Spock initialization job with this command:

```shell
kubectl logs --follow jobs/pgedge-init-spock
```

Once the job has completed, you should see the following message which indicates the chart has been successfully installed.

```shell
âžœ helm install \
--values examples/configs/single/values.yaml \
        --wait \
        pgedge ./

NAME: pgedge
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Oct 10 14:07:41 2025
NAMESPACE: pgedge
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

## Uninstallation

If you wish to uninstall the pgedge-helm chart, you can perform a `helm uninstall` using the following command:

```shell
helm uninstall pgedge
```

All resources will be removed, with the exception of secrets which were created to store generated client certificates by `cert-manager`. 

This is a safety mechanism which aligns with cert-manager's default behavior, and ensures that dependent services are not brought down by an accidental update.

If you wish to delete these secrets, you can identify then via `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl get secrets

NAME                 TYPE                DATA   AGE
pgedge-admin-client-cert    kubernetes.io/tls   3      3m43s
pgedge-app-client-cert      kubernetes.io/tls   3      3m43s
pgedge-client-ca-key-pair   kubernetes.io/tls   3      3m46s
pgedge-pgedge-client-cert   kubernetes.io/tls   3      3m45s
```

From there, you can delete each secret using the following command:

`kubectl delete secret <name>`
