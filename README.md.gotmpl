## Overview

### Pre-requisites

In order for this chart to work, you must pre-install two operators into your Kubernetes clusters:

- [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/)
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) 

You can install these like this:

```
	kubectl apply --server-side -f \
		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.27/releases/cnpg-1.27.0.yaml
	kubectl apply -f \
		https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```

### Values file

This chart is built around managing each pgEdge node as a [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) `Cluster`.

The chart contains a default `clusterSpec` in `values.yaml` which sets up required configuration for pgEdge, including:

- Using the [pgEdge Enterprise Postgres Image](https://github.com/pgedge/postgres-images)
- Loading and initializing required extensions for pgEdge Distributed Postgres
- Setting up required PostgreSQL configuration parameters
- Configuring client certificate authentication for managed users (app, admin, streaming_replica)
- Allowing local connections for the `app` and `admin` users for testing / development purposes

The simplest example values file, which deploys a single primary instance for each node, looks like this:

```yaml
pgEdge:
  appName: pgedge
  nodes:
    - name: n1
      hostname: pgedge-n1-rw
    - name: n2
      hostname: pgedge-n2-rw
    - name: n3
      hostname: pgedge-n3-rw
  clusterSpec:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
```

As shown, The default `clusterSpec` can be overridden for all nodes with specific configuration required for your Kubernetes setup.

In addition, you can override the `clusterSpec` for individual nodes. 

For example, to create a 3-node cluster with 3 instances on node `n1` and single instances on nodes `n2` and `n3`, you could use:

```yaml
pgEdge:
  appName: pgedge
  nodes:
    - name: n1
      hostname: pgedge-n1-rw
      clusterSpec: 
        instances: 3
        minSyncReplicas: 1
        maxSyncReplicas: 2
    - name: n2
      hostname: pgedge-n2-rw
    - name: n3
      hostname: pgedge-n3-rw
```

This override behavior is enabled via `mergeOverwrite` in Helm. You should be mindful that lists are replaced, not merged.

If you override a list in the `clusterSpec` for a node, you must include all required elements in that list, pulling from the values file example, and using `helm template` to verify your configuration.

## Certificates

This chart leverages cert-manager to create a self-signed CA and issue client certificates for a set of managed users on each node:

- `app`: a user for application connections
- `admin`: a superuser for administrative purposes
- `pgedge`: used for multi-active replication connections between nodes
- `streaming_replica`: used for physical replication connections between nodes

This makes it easier to get started with pgEdge, but you may want to use your own CA in production.

In that case, you can disable the self-signed CA creation and certificate issuance by setting
`pgEdge.provisionCerts` to `false`, and issuing your own certificates using cert-manager or another tool.

These can then be plugged into your clusterSpec accordingly:

```yaml
pgEdge:
  appName: pgedge
  provisionCerts: false
  nodes:
    - name: n1
      hostname: pgedge-n1-rw        
    - name: n2
      hostname: pgedge-n2-rw
    - name: n3
      hostname: pgedge-n3-rw
  clusterSpec:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
    certificates:
        clientCASecret: <secret-containing-client-ca>
        replicationTLSSecret: <secret-containing-replication-tls-cert>
```

## Spock initialization

This chart contains a python job to initialize spock multi-master replication across all nodes once they are all available.

This job runs by default, waiting for any clusters within the namespace to be ready before performing initialization.

If you wish to disable this behavior, you can set `pgEdge.initSpock` to `false`.

## Multi-cluster considerations

If you are deploying nodes across multiple Kubernetes clusters, you must take additional steps to leverage this chart, since Helm is not designed to manage resources across multiple clusters by default.

This includes:

1. Installing the required operators (CloudNativePG and cert-manager) into each Kubernetes cluster.
2. Creating required certificates for managed users (app, admin, pgedge, streaming_replica) in each Kubernetes cluster.
3. Installing the chart into each Kubernetes cluster separately, with the following configuration:
  a. Setting `pgEdge.initSpock` to `false` to defer spock initialization until a later deployment.
  b. Setting the `pgEdge.nodes` property to only list nodes which should be deployed in a particular cluster.
4. Exposing the read/write services for each node across clusters using Kubernetes network tools like Cilium or Submariner to enable cross-cluster DNS and connectivity.
5. Installing the chart into one of the clusters with all nodes listed under `pgEdge.externalNodes` and `pgEdge.initSpock` set to `true` to initialize spock configuration.

## Examples

See the [examples README](./examples/README.md) for instructions to try this chart using local
Kubernetes clusters created with [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

## Limitations

- Certificate Management: The chart creates a self-signed CA and issues certificates for managed users on each node, but it does not issue or configure server certificates.
  You may manage server certificates yourself using cert-manager and CloudNativePG, but the chart may require modification to use verify-full mode for client connections.
- Node Management: Adding nodes is supported by updating the `pgEdge.nodes` value and running a helm upgrade
  However, this operation currently requires downtime while the spock iniitalization job runs again
- Node Management: Removing nodes is not supported. You may remove the node from `pgEdge.nodes` and run a helm upgrade,
  but you must manually clean up spock subscriptions on the remaining nodes using spock's SQL interface
