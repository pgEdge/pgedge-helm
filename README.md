# pgedge

pgEdge is fully distributed PostgreSQL with multi-active replication. This
chart installs pgEdge Distributed Postgres as a StatefulSet.

![Version: 0.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.2-informational?style=flat-square)

## Commonly used values

Most users will want to specify a database name and user names:

```yaml
pgEdge:
  dbSpec:
    dbName: my_application
    users:
      - username: my_application
        superuser: false
        service: postgres
        type: application
      - username: admin
        # Note this user will only have a subset of superuser privileges to exclude the abilities to
        # read files and execute programs on the host.
        superuser: true
        service: postgres
        type: admin
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not update database users via the Helm chart after they're created. Instead, you should either
> modify the `pgedge-users` secret directly or create a new secret with updated values and specify
> it via the `pgEdge.existingUsersSecret` value. See the [Limitations](#limitations) section below
> for additional caveats on user management.

## Examples

See the [examples README](./examples/README.md) for instructions to try this chart using local
Kubernetes clusters created with [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

## Limitations

Most of the pgEdge cluster configuration is set when it's first initialized, and further changes to
the configuration are not read. This behavior affects two main areas:

- Horizontal scaling
  - Increasing the number of nodes in the cluster beyond its initial configuration requires
    additional work to notify the existing pgEdge nodes about the new pgEdge nodes.
- User management
  - After initialization, the only user that's read from the users secret at startup is the internal
    `pgedge` user.
  - New users can be created via SQL, but note that they must be created on every pgEdge separately.
  - Similarly, credential rotation must be performed on each pgEdge node individually. In the case
    of the `pgedge` user, the password in `pgedge-users` secret should also be updated.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| annotations | object | `{}` | Additional annotations to apply to all created objects. |
| labels | object | `{}` | Additional labels to apply to all created objects. |
| pgEdge.appName | string | `"pgedge"` | Determines the name of resources in the pgEdge cluster. Many other values are derived from this name, so it must be less than or equal to 26 characters in length. |
| pgEdge.clusterSpec | object | `{"affinity":{"nodeSelector":{}},"bootstrap":{"initdb":{"database":"app","encoding":"UTF8","owner":"app","postInitApplicationSQL":["CREATE EXTENSION spock;","CREATE EXTENSION snowflake;","CREATE EXTENSION lolor;"],"postInitSQL":[],"postInitTemplateSQL":[]}},"certificates":{"clientCASecret":"client-ca-key-pair","replicationTLSSecret":"streaming-replica-client-cert"},"instances":1,"postgresql":{"parameters":{"checkpoint_completion_target":"0.9","checkpoint_timeout":"15min","dynamic_shared_memory_type":"posix","hot_standby_feedback":"on","spock.allow_ddl_from_functions":"on","spock.conflict_log_level":"DEBUG","spock.conflict_resolution":"last_update_wins","spock.enable_ddl_replication":"on","spock.include_ddl_repset":"on","spock.save_resolutions":"on","sync_replication_slots":"on","track_commit_timestamp":"on","track_io_timing":"on","wal_level":"logical","wal_sender_timeout":"5s"},"shared_preload_libraries":["pg_stat_statements","snowflake","spock"]}}` | Default CNPG Cluster specification applied to all nodes, which can be overridden on a per-node basis using the `clusterSpec` field in each node definition. |
| pgEdge.nodes | list | `[]` | Configuration for each node in the cluster. Each node will be deployed as a separate CNPG Cluster. |
| pgEdge.pgMajorVersion | int | `17` | Sets the major version of PostgreSQL to use. Must be one of the major versions defined in the   included ImageCatalog. The default is 17, which uses PostgreSQL 17 with pgEdge extensions. |
| pgEdge.provisionCerts | bool | `true` | - Whether to deploy cert-manager to manage TLS certificates for the cluster. If false, you must provide your own TLS certificates by creating the secrets defined in `clusterSpec.certificates.clientCASecret` and `clusterSpec.certificates.replicationTLSSecret`. |
